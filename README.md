# LipNet_Lip_Reading_Deep_Neural_Network
This project is focused on developing an AI-powered lip reading system that processes video frames of a speaker and predicts the spoken words. The system leverages Deep Learning techniques combining 3D-CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and BiLSTMs (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks) to extract and interpret visual speech patterns.
